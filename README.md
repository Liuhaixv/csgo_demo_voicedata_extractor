## Notice
Be aware of that the extracted data is encoded with `CELT`, u need to decode it with [CELT header file](https://github.com/mumble-voip/celt-0.11.0) and CSGO's .dll(Windows) or .so(Linux) 

If u are using Windows, here is my decoder repository ðŸ‘‰ [csgo_demo_voicedata_decoder](https://github.com/Liuhaixv/csgo_demo_voicedata_decoder)
